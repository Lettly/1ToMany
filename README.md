# 1 To Many
  
1TM is a broadcast system without a centralized server between the peer, which allows you to send messages from a peer "server" to various peers "clients".  
This is to be considered a concept to develop larger projects.

## Usage

 1. Go to the [sender](https://lettly.github.io/1ToMany/send.html) web page and copy the id
 2. Go to the [receiver](https://lettly.github.io/1ToMany/receive.html) web page and paste the id
 3. Repeat point `2` as many times you prefer
